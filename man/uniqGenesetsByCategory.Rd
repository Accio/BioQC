\title{Make names of gene-sets unique by category, and member genes of gene-sets unique}
\usage{
uniqGenesetsByCategory(gmtList, category = gsDesc)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmtList}{A \code{GmtList} object, probably from \code{\link[BioQC]{readGmt}}. The object must have categories defined by \code{setCategory}.}

\item{category}{Either a function that can be applied to \code{GmtList} to extract category, or a vector of the same length as \code{GmtList}, specifying the category, or NULL (or a list of NULLs). Default value: \code{gsDesc}, namely the \code{desc} field of the list elements of \code{GmtList} is used as category.

The function make sure that
\itemize{
  \item names of gene-sets within each category are unique, by merging gene-sets with duplicated names
  \item genes within each gene-set are unique, by removing duplicated genes
}

Gene-sets with duplicated names and different \code{desc} are merged, \code{desc} are made unique, and in case of multiple values, concatenated (with \code{|} as the collapse character).}
}
\value{
A \code{GmtList} object, with unique gene-sets and unique gene lists. If not already present, a new item \code{category} is appended to each \code{list} element in the \code{GmtList} object, recording the category used to make gene-sets unique. The order of the returned \code{GmtList} object is given by the unique gene-set name of the input object.
