In this vignette, explain the underlaying algorithmic details of our
implementation of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The source code used
to produce this document can be found in the github repository
[BioQC](https://github.com/Accio/BioQC/vignettes).

*BioQC* is a R/Bioconductor package to detect tissue heterogeneity from
high-throughput gene expression profiling data. It implements an
efficient Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and offers tissue-specific gene
signatures that are ready to use 'out of the box'.

Algorithmic improvements {#algorithmic-improvements}
------------------------

The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is a non-parametric statistical
test to test if two population means are equal or not. Unlike the
t-test, it does not require the assumption of normal distributions
making it more robust against noise.

We improved the computational efficiency of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test in comparison to the native R implementation based on three
modifications:

1.  use the approximative WMW-statistic (Zar, J. H. (1999).
    Biostatistical analysis. Pearson Education India. *pp.* 174-177).
    The differences to the exact version are negligible for
    high-throughput gene expression data.
2.  use C instead of R as programming language
3.  avoid futile expensive sorting operations

While (1) and (2) are straightforward, we elaborate (3) in the
following.

Let *W*<sub>*a*,‚ÄÜ*b*</sub> be the approximative WMW test of two gene
vectors *a*,‚ÄÜ*b*, where *a* is the gene set of interest, typically
containing less than a few hundreds of genes, and *b* is the set of all
genes outside the gene set (*background genes*) typically containing
‚ÄÑ\>‚ÄÑ10000 genes. In the context of BioQC, the gene sets are referred to
as *tissue signatures*.

Given an *m*‚ÄÖ√ó‚ÄÖ*n* input matrix of gene expression data with *m* genes
and *n* samples *s*<sub>1</sub>,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜ*s*<sub>*n*</sub>, and *k* gene sets
*d*<sub>1</sub>,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜ*d*<sub>*k*</sub>, the WMW-test needs to be applied
for each sample *s*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*i*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ1..*n* and each gene set
*d*<sub>*j*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*j*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ1..*k*. The runtime of the WMW-test is
essentially determined by the sorting operation on the two input
vectors. Using native R `wilcox.test`, the vectors *a* and *b* are
sorted individually for each gene set. However, in the context of gene
set analysis, this is futile, as the (large) background set changes
insignificantly in relation to the (small) gene set, when testing
different gene sets on the same sample.

Therefore, we approximate the WMW-test by extending *b* to all genes in
the sample, keeping the background unchanged when testing multiple gene
sets. Like this, *b* has to be sorted only once per sample. The
individual gene sets still need to be sorted, which is not a major
issue, as they are small in comparison to the set of background genes.

Time benchmark {#time-benchmark}
--------------

To demonstrate BioQC's superior performance, we apply both BioQC and the
native R `wilcox.test` to random expression matrices and measure the
runtime.

We setup random expression matrices of 20534 human protein-coding genes
of 1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 samples. Genes are *i*.*i*.*d* distributed
following ùí©(0,‚ÄÜ1). The native R and the *BioQC* implementations of the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test are applied to the matrices respectively.

The numeric results of both implementations, `bioqcNumRes` (from
*BioQC*) and `rNumRes` (from *R*), are equivalent, as shown by the next
command.

~~~~ r
expect_equal(bioqcNumRes, rNumRes)
~~~~

The *BioQC* implementation is more than 500 times faster: while it takes
about one second for BioQC to calculate enrichment scores of all 155
signatures in 100 samples, the native R implementation takes about 20
minutes:

Conclusion {#conclusion}
----------

We have shown that *BioQC* achieves identical results as the native
implementation in two orders of magnitude less time. This renders
*BioQC* a highly efficient tool for quality control of large-scale
high-throughput gene expression data.
