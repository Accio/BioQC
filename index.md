BioQC is a R/[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BioQC.html) package to detect tissue heterogeneity in gene expression data. To this end BioQC implements a computationally efficient Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and provides more than 150 signatures of tissue-enriched genes derived from large-scale transcriptomics studies. 

Simulation studies show that BioQC is both fast and sensitive in detecting tissue heterogeneity.
